Run file MainFunction.py to compile the system.

!!!!!!
Calling function Run() is going to take more than 1 hour to download all tweets and perform sentiment analysis on them
Files are already downloaded in the directory
Run file LSTM_No_Sentiment.py to run the Neural Network model 1

Bitcoin price prediction using Machine Learning algortihms and Twitter sentiment analysis.
This system predicts the daily Bitcoin price bu using Machine Learning Neural Network LSTM archtiecture.
The system performs sentiment analysis on tweets related to Bitcoin and produces daily compound score which represents
the sentiment of tweets for a specific day.
Later the sentiment compound score is combined with the Bitcoin market statistics into one dataset which is used for training and testing
the algorithm.
Further details explained in the code comments.
To compile the system, run the MainFunction.py file which is going to call Run() function that is goingt to load and compile everything neccesary.
