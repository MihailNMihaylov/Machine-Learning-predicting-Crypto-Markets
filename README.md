# Machine-Learning-predicting-Crypto-Markets
Machine Learning Algorithm predicting the price of Crypto currencies.
Long Short Term Memory Neural Networks are going to predict the future movement of the price of some Crypto currencies by making precise estimations based on two main factors.
The first factor is the  market information (current demand of the currency, current supply and numbers). The algorithm is going to analyze the data and distinguish patterns for later recognition.
The second factor is the media and the news. The algoritm is algo going to monitore what are the recent news about the crypto currency and based on the sentiment of the information it is going to make predictions. The algorith is going to analyze tweets from sources that can heavily affect the price.
Everything is going to be displayed on a user-friendly GUI.
